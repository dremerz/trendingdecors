										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap-letter">A</span></span> faceting effect livens up and interrupts the cubism that sets the morphology of the West system apart from the cliches of modern design. Characterised by its suitability for use in a wide range of different contemporary and traditional arrangements, West also features glints of pure creativity, such as the chaise-longue, in pentagonal or hexagonal form and the elements that stand out for their striking backrests in saddle hide, ergonomically shaped to rise and support the rear cushion. True elements of surprise, they break up the compositional layout, creating a stylistic point of interest, and interrupting the continuous effect of the fabric covering, visually lightening the volume at the rear. A solution designed to optimise both look and form, created with the know-how about design and the savoir-faire associated with fine tailoring that have <span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-weight: 600;">always distinguished the Minotti brand</span>.</p>
<p>Every element of the system is made with exquisite goose down padding to ensure maximum comfort, features cushions finished with a piping that defines their profile and a distinctive aluminium strip, slightly rounded at the edges which skims the floor, in a brand new polished Brandy colour finish.</p>

<p>West leaves plenty of room for interesting compositional possibilities: it enters a harmonious dialogue in terms of both colour and shape with the Amber coffee tables, is complemented by the Side coffee tables, with their frame in saddle hide that evokes that of the backrest and enhanced by the Clive consoles, which play around with surfaces, even setting one over another. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #a9a9a9; text-decoration: underline;">The combination of the two looks of West</span></span>, one with backrest in saddle hide and the other more conventional version with padded backrest and armrest.</p>

<p>Caule for Flos is an outdoor lighting collection with simple understated lines yet strong style identity. Copying the botanical structure of a flower, the collection features a real flexible slender stem, almost a natural element, a subtle addition to any outdoor setting. Available in different heights and configurations, the Caule <span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-weight: 600;">series comes in a variety of materials and surface finishes.</span></p>
<p><em>The bulky look created by the solid sculptural masses of the semi-circular legs of Wedge contrasts with the lightweight feet, which culminate in an oblique chisel tip shape.</em></p>
