Characterised by its suitability for use in a wide range of different contemporary and traditional arrangements, West also features glints of pure creativity, such as the chaise-longue, in pentagonal or hexagonal form and the elements that stand out for their striking backrests in saddle hide, ergonomically shaped to rise and support the rear cushion. True elements of surprise, they break up the compositional layout, creating a stylistic point of interest, and interrupting the continuous effect of the fabric covering, visually lightening the volume at the rear.
